== How to contribute

I’m really glad you’re reading this, because we need volunteer
developers to help this project come to fruition.

=== Submitting changes

Please send a
https://github.com/trento-project/trento/pull/new/main[GitHub Pull
Request to Trento] with a clear list of what you’ve done (read more
about http://help.github.com/pull-requests/[pull requests]). When you
send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include updates and
extensions to the Golang Tests. We can always use more test coverage.
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your
commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are
fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
[source,bash]
....
git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit 
A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
....

=== Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you’ll get the hang of it. We optimize for
readability:

* We indent using four spaces (soft tabs)
* We use the https://golang.org/doc/effective_go[Effective Go]
guidelines by default
