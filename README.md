# Trento Helm Charts

Helm charts to deploy Trento components in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

After that, refer to each individual chart documentation to find more information:

- [trento-server](docs/trento-server.md): Chart to deploy a fully functional Trento server, including the Web and Wanda components, plus other auxiliary services.

### Optional: SSL with cert-manager

[cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is a Kubernetes add-on that automates the management and issuance of TLS certificates. It can be optionally enabled in this Helm chart to provide SSL support for secure communication. While it simplifies certificate management and renewal, it introduces additional cluster-wide resources. For detailed setup instructions and considerations, refer to the [`hack/cert-manager/`](/hack/cert-manager/README.md) cookbook.

### Optional: mTLS authentication with RabbitMQ

mTLS authentication with RabbitMQ can be enabled through the `global.rabbitmq.tls` configuration section. This feature enhances security by ensuring mutual authentication between RabbitMQ and its clients. 
When mTLS is enabled, the following secrets are expected to exist in the Kubernetes namespace:

1. `rabbitmq-server-tls`
    - `ca.crt`: Root CA certificate for the RabbitMQ server
    - `tls.crt`: Server certificate for RabbitMQ
    - `tls.key`: Private key for the RabbitMQ server certificate
2. `rabbitmq-ca`
    - `ca.crt`: Root CA certificate for the RabbitMQ server (same as above)
3. `web-rabbitmq-client-tls`
    - `ca.crt`: Root CA certificate for web component
    - `client.crt`: Client certificate for web component
    - `client.key`: Private key for web client certificate
4. `wanda-rabbitmq-client-tls`
    - `ca.crt`: Root CA certificate for wanda component
    - `client.crt`: Client certificate for wanda component
    - `client.key`: Private key for wanda client certificate
